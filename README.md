# flomat-expm

An improved version of flomat's `expm` implementation, closely (but not exactly) following MATLAB's `expm` function for matrices smaller than 50×50.

## ⚠ **Attention:**
- This implementation has **not** been thoroughly tested yet, **use at your own risk!**
- The function assumes that input matrices are **smaller than 50×50**.
- There may still be **bugs** present in the implementation.
